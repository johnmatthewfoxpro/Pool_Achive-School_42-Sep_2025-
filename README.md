# Pool_Achive-School_42-Sep_2025-
A dump repository of most of the work I did during the month long Picsine or Pool with School 42. This is more meant for posterity than reference as most of these files make no sense on their own or without corresponding mains. 

## __DESCRIPTION__
This archive holds my work from the September 2025 piscine with school 42. 

I completed the sections from Shell00 all the way to C07.

This archive serves as a glimpse of my understanding of coding in 2025. There is no real utility on offer with this repo, the functions themselves are not usable without a written main which is not included in most examples.

Note: In most cases only the mandatory part of each unit was completed.

## __RESOURCES__
AI was not used in this project.
